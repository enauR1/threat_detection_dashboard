Analyze the following firewall log entry. Determine whether it is suspicious. If so, classify the threat type, assign a severity level (1‚Äì10), and suggest an appropriate response action.

\[2025-05-07 10:01:12] SRC=192.168.1.10 DST=10.0.0.2 PROTO=TCP DPT=22 ACTION=DROP MSG=Multiple failed SSH login attempts


### üîç **Firewall Log Analysis**

```
[2025-05-07 10:02:33] 
SRC=203.0.113.45 
DST=10.0.0.3 
PROTO=TCP 
DPT=80 
ACTION=ACCEPT 
MSG=Normal HTTP request
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Is It Suspicious?**

**No.** This log entry appears **normal** and **not suspicious**.

#### Here's why:

* **Destination Port 80** indicates standard **HTTP web traffic**.
* **ACTION=ACCEPT** means the firewall allowed the traffic.
* The **MSG=Normal HTTP request** suggests there was **no detected anomaly** in the request pattern.
* The **source IP** (`203.0.113.45`) is a **public IP**, likely representing an external client or user accessing a web server, which is expected behavior for a public-facing HTTP service.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Conclusion:**

* **Threat Type:** *None detected*
* **Severity Level:** *0/10*
* **Response Action:** *No immediate action required.*

However, it is always good practice to:

* Ensure the destination server (`10.0.0.3`) is patched and secured.
* Monitor for spikes in similar traffic that could indicate probing or denial-of-service attempts.

Would you like help setting up a rule to flag only abnormal HTTP traffic patterns going forward?


Satisfactory response, no false positive. Solo prompts working well.
