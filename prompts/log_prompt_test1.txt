Analyze the following firewall log entry. Determine whether it is suspicious. If so, classify the threat type, assign a severity level (1–10), and suggest an appropriate response action.

\[2025-05-07 10:01:12] SRC=192.168.1.10 DST=10.0.0.2 PROTO=TCP DPT=22 ACTION=DROP MSG=Multiple failed SSH login attempts

Patrick, that response is **fantastic** — it’s exactly the kind of high-quality AI output we want to build this entire project around. Let's break down why this is a strong start and what you should do next:

---

## ✅ Why This Prompt Result is Strong

* 🔍 **Accurate breakdown of log fields**
* ⚠️ **Correct threat classification** (brute-force attempt)
* 📊 **Reasonable severity rating** with justification
* 🧩 **Well-structured response plan** — perfect for a junior SOC analyst interface
* 💬 **Human-readable and actionable** — this is portfolio-quality AI output

---

## 🗂️ What You Should Do Next

### 🔹 1. Save This Prompt + Output

📁 Create a file called:

```
/ai-threat-detection-dashboard/prompts/log_prompt_test1.md
```

📄 Paste in:

* The prompt you used
* The log you tested
* The full AI output
* Add a quick line below:
  `✅ Result accepted – high quality, clear, structured response.`

This will be your **first archived prompt template**.

---

### 🔹 2. Document the Test

In your `/docs/internship-log-week1.txt`, update with:

```markdown
**Prompt Test #1:**  
- Input: Brute-force SSH log  
- Output: AI correctly identified threat, rated severity, and recommended realistic responses  
- Notes: Very strong result. Will use this format as template for future logs.
```

---

### 🔹 3. Try Prompt #2

Pick a **different log** from your `sample_logs.txt` and paste it into the same base prompt.
Here’s the log you could try next:

```text
[2025-05-07 10:06:23] SRC=198.51.100.2 DST=10.0.0.7 PROTO=UDP DPT=161 ACTION=DROP MSG=Unauthorized SNMP access
```

Use the same prompt:

> “Analyze the following firewall log entry. Determine whether it is suspicious. If so, classify the threat type, assign a severity level (1–10), and suggest an appropriate response action.”

📌 Then save it as:
`/prompts/log_prompt_test2.md`

---

### 📌 Optional Improvement Ideas (Later This Week)

* Ask the AI to format results in **JSON or table format** for easier parsing
* Try summarizing multiple logs at once (batch classification)
* Add a follow-up prompt like: *"Would you consider this part of a coordinated attack pattern?"*

---

Would you like to test the second prompt now, or want help rewriting the original prompt to make it shorter or output-structured?
