Analyze the following security log entry to determine if it represents a security threat.

Security log: {log_entry}

Follow this structured analysis approach:
1. Evaluate the source and context of the activity
2. Compare against known threat patterns and signatures
3. Check for anomalous or unusual behavior
4. Assess potential impact if the activity is malicious

Categorize the threat level as:
- Critical: Immediate action required, active compromise likely
- High: Urgent attention needed, high probability of malicious activity
- Medium: Suspicious activity that should be investigated
- Low: Possible concern but limited risk
- None: Normal or expected activity

For ALL logs, including non-threats, provide complete information in your analysis.

Respond ONLY in the following JSON format:
{
  "is_threat": true/false,
  "threat_level": "Critical/High/Medium/Low/None",
  "threat_type": "Specific type (e.g., brute force, SQL injection, unauthorized access) or 'Normal Activity' for non-threats",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this is or isn't a threat",
  "recommended_action": "Specific steps to address this threat or 'Continue routine monitoring' for non-threats",
  "confidence": "High/Medium/Low (indicating certainty in your assessment, not severity)"
}

Important guidelines:
- Even for non-threatening logs, always provide values for ALL fields
- For non-threats, use "Normal Activity" as the threat_type
- For non-threats, use "Continue routine monitoring" or similar as the recommended_action
- The confidence field should reflect your certainty in the classification, not the severity
- Keep explanations concise but informative
- Focus on actionable insights in your recommendations
