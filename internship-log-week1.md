Thanks for calling that out ‚Äî you're absolutely right to expect the full detail. I trimmed for clarity and visual appeal in Markdown, but you‚Äôre doing a **high-accountability internship**, and detail matters.

Let me restore **everything** you originally wrote ‚Äî but with just enough formatting to make it clean, readable, and still professional for your `.md` log file.

### üìÅ Here's the **fully restored and formatted version** of your Week 1 log:

# üßæ Internship Log ‚Äì Week 1

**Dates:** May 7 ‚Äì May 13, 2025

---

### üìÖ May 5, 2025

**Total Hours Worked:** 3

---

**Tasks Completed:**

* Researched three capstone projects
* Finalized decisions for three projects
* Used ChatGPT and Deepseek to generate detailed descriptions of each capstone project
* Created weekly breakdowns and structured reports for deliverables, software/resources used, and skills gained

---

### üìÖ May 8, 2025

**Total Hours Worked:** 3.5

---

**Tasks Completed:**

* Created structured folder system for local project development
* Generated 10 simulated firewall/IDS log entries
* Ran prompt test on log #1 (SSH brute-force)

  * Output: Identified correctly as brute-force, rated severity 6/10, gave strong mitigation advice
* Ran prompt test on log #2 (normal HTTP traffic)

  * Output: Correctly marked as non-suspicious, severity 0/10, with passive recommendations
* Ran prompt test on a batch of 8 logs

  * Output: Structured table identifying suspicious entries, threat types, and mitigation strategies
  * Confirmed ability to handle multi-log triage and prioritize incidents
* Ran prompt test #4 to test structured JSON output

  * Output: AI returned clean JSON for a suspicious SNMP log with proper severity and classification

‚úÖ Validated prompt for API automation in next development phase

---

**üß† Observations & Lessons Learned:**

* Prompt format greatly affects response clarity ‚Äî adding structure improves accuracy
* Batch prompts are effective and scalable; useful for triage use cases
* JSON output will make integration into Python pipeline and Streamlit dashboard seamless
* GitHub can be deferred until end-of-week push to focus on progress

---

**üìå Next Steps (Tomorrow):**
Begin Phase 2:

* Build Python script to:

  * Read logs from file
  * Send each line to LLM using finalized prompt
  * Parse and save structured output (e.g., JSON or DataFrame)
* Archive all successful prompt versions
* Start designing initial Streamlit dashboard layout (basic table + severity filter)

---

### üìÖ May 9, 2025

**Total Hours Worked:** 4

---

**Tasks Completed:**

* Watched instructional videos and tutorials on Visual Studio Code and basic Python scripting to build foundational understanding for the project
* Installed and explored VS Code interface, extensions (including JSON formatting), and project navigation tools
* Learned about `.json` file handling, Python indentation rules, and terminal usage inside VS Code
* Created and initialized GitHub repository for the ‚ÄúAI-Driven Threat Detection Dashboard‚Äù project
* Practiced formatting and validating JSON data in preparation for log analysis and UI integration

---

**Note:**
Time was primarily focused on learning and environment setup. These steps were essential for becoming comfortable with the tools required to build, test, and maintain the AI-driven cybersecurity dashboard.

---

### üìÖ May 10, 2025

**Total Hours Worked:** 6

---

**Tasks Completed:**

* Generated 10 additional diverse simulated firewall/IDS log entries to expand the project‚Äôs testing dataset (`sample_logs_batch2.txt`)
* Used ChatGPT (GPT-4o) to analyze all 10 log entries in a single batch using a structured prompt for threat classification, severity scoring, and recommended responses
* Reviewed and validated the AI-generated output for consistency and realism
* Saved the structured results in a well-formatted JSON file (`log_analysis_results_batch2.json`) for future backend processing and dashboard display
* Created and organized project folders using Visual Studio Code, including `/data/` for storing logs and results
* Verified functionality of JSON formatting tools and began working comfortably within VS Code
* Troubleshot and resolved Python installation and PATH configuration issues on Windows (1.5 hours)
* Verified successful Python installation in VS Code and terminal environments
* Created `/src/` subfolder and added initial script file (`log_analyzer.py`) for log analysis
* Updated the Python script to simulate AI-based threat classification using random logic
* Corrected broken relative paths in file references to align with project structure
* Successfully ran the Python script to read sample logs and write a structured JSON output file (`simulated_output.json`)
* Validated output structure and ensured script output could be used for future dashboard integration
* Continued using and gaining familiarity with VS Code‚Äôs folder management, terminal, and JSON editing tools

---

### üìÖ May 11‚Äì12, 2025

**Total Hours Worked:** 6

---

**Tasks Completed:**

* Refined and restructured the log analysis Python script (`log_analyzer.py`) to more accurately simulate AI-powered threat classification
* Rebuilt rule-based classification logic to identify threats based on both `DPT` port numbers and key phrases in the log message (`MSG`)
* Added proper handling for common attack vectors including SSH brute force, RDP login attempts, SMB probing, Telnet, FTP, and SNMP scans
* Implemented fallback handling for DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and benign web crawler traffic
* Enhanced threat detection output with specific severity levels and actionable recommendations
* Validated accuracy of the final `simulated_output.json` file and confirmed alignment with intended classifications
* Debugged minor print formatting issues and improved the quality and realism of the output for use in a future dashboard
